/*
 * TLDR: With generators you can write Effect code that looks imperative!
 * It's an equivalent to what ZIO does in Scala-land with for comprehensions.
 *
 * Admittedly, `gen(function* ($) {` and `yield* $(` add quite a bit of noise,
 * but considering the limitations of JavaScript and TypeScript, it's quite
 * amazing that this is possible at all.
 *
 *
 * Snippets are advised to write out the `gen(function *($)` and `yield* $()`
 * boilerplate. For reference, I setup mine like this:
